About me
======

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on the intersection of Development, Industrial Organization, and Trade.

In the Summer of 2025, I will be teaching PPE 3001/Econ 0120 (*Strategic Reasoning*) at the University of Pennsylvania.
