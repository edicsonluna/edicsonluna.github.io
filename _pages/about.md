About me
======

Welcome! I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests focus on the intersection of Development, Industrial Organization, and Trade.

I earned my undergraduate degree in Economics at Universidad del Pac√≠fico (Peru) and my master's degree in Economics at Universidad de los Andes (Colombia).
