About me
======

Welcome! I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, entering my third year in the 2025â€“2026 academic year. My third year paper will study how individuals rely on informal networks to offset low wages and high commuting costs.

My broader research interests center on welfare analysis from a labor economics perspective, with a particular focus on automation, family structures, and urban dynamics. I am open to collaborations with fellow PhD students who share similar interests.

I hold a BA in Economics from Universidad del PacÃ­fico (Peru) and an MA in Economics from Universidad de los Andes (Colombia).
