About me
======

Welcome! I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on Development, incorporating insights from Industrial Organization, Trade, and Machine Learning.

I earned my undergraduate degree in Economics at Universidad del Pac√≠fico (Peru) and my master's degree in Economics at Universidad de los Andes (Colombia).

This summer, I will teach *Strategic Reasoning* (PPE 3001/Econ 0120) at the University of Pennsylvania.
