**Strategic Reasoning (ECON 0120 / PPE 3001)** introduces students to the fundamentals of game theory and strategic decision-making. The course emphasizes intuitive understanding and practical applications, rather than formal proofs, and draws examples from business, economics, politics, and sports. This class is part of the **PPE** and **Economics** undergraduate curriculum at Penn and is open to students with basic algebra and strong numeracy skills.

Topics include sequential and simultaneous-move games, Nash equilibrium (discrete and continuous choices), mixed strategies, risk and asymmetric information, repeated games and the Prisoner’s Dilemma, and collective action problems.
