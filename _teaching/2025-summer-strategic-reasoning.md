**Strategic Reasoning (ECON 0120 / PPE 3001)** introduces students to the fundamentals of game theory and strategic decision-making. The course emphasizes intuitive understanding and practical applications, rather than formal proofs, and draws examples from business, economics, politics, and sports.

Classes are held synchronously (M/W/F 7:00–8:30 PM) with complementary asynchronous content and are conducted entirely online via Zoom.

Topics include:

- Sequential and simultaneous-move games  
- Nash equilibrium (discrete and continuous choices)  
- Mixed strategies  
- Risk and asymmetric information  
- Repeated games and the Prisoner’s Dilemma  
- Collective action and coordination problems

The course includes three quizzes, two take-home exams, two problem sets, and short presentations. Students interact through in-class games and online discussions.

This class is part of the **PPE** and **Economics** undergraduate curriculum at Penn and is open to students with basic algebra and strong numeracy skills.
