This course introduces the fundamental tools economists use to quantify relationships between economic variables, focusing on causal inference and prediction. Emphasis is placed on the linear regression model, including its assumptions, estimation, inference, and applications. Students learn to distinguish correlation from causality and apply econometric methods to real-world questions. The course combines theoretical instruction with applied sessions using the R programming language.
